# Forward-Playing-Styles

This Python code examines event data in the 2021/22 season from the top 5 European soccer leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Seria A). The goal of this mini-project was to determine clusters of forwards (Wingers, Strikers, Center Forwards) in the top 5 leagues and to determine what specific play styles exist based on event data including shooting, passing, pressing, and dribbling statistics. 

Methods used: Principal Component Analysis, K-means Clustering
